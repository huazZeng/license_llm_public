of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\nThe Affero GPL is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works\nBy contrast, our GPLs are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nOur GPLs are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things\nDevelopers that use our GPLs protect your rights with two steps<colon>\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software\nMany developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation\nThe GPL permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public\nThe Affero GPL is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community\nAn older license, called the Affero GPL and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals\nThis is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has <LICENSED> a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n<quotes>This License<quotes> refers to <VERSION> of the Affero GPL\n<quotes>Copyright<quotes> also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks\n<quotes>The Program<quotes> refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nTo <quotes>modify<quotes> a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy\nTo <quotes>propagate<quotes> a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy\nTo <quotes>convey<quotes> a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies\nAn interactive user interface displays <quotes>Appropriate Legal Notices<quotes> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met\nThis License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program\nThe output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work\nThis License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright\nThose thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below\nProtecting Users<quotes> Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work<quotes>s users, your or third parties<quotes> legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures\nConveying Verbatim Copies\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy\nThis License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged\nThis License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an <quotes>aggregate<quotes> if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation<quotes>s users beyond what the individual works permit\nInclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways<colon>\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed\nAdditional Terms\n<quotes>Additional permissions<quotes> are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law\nIf additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms<colon>\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered <quotes>further restrictions<quotes> within the meaning of section 10\nIf the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term\nIf a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11)\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License\nIf your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program\nHowever, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work\nThese actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\nIf propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party<quotes>s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License\nFor example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it\nA <quotes>contributor<quotes> is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based\nThe work thus licensed is called the contributor<quotes>s <quotes>contributor version<quotes>\nA contributor<quotes>s <quotes>essential patent claims<quotes> are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version\nFor purposes of this definition, <quotes>control<quotes> includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor<quotes>s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version\nIn the following three paragraphs, a <quotes>patent license<quotes> is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement)\nTo <quotes>grant<quotes> such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients\n<quotes>Knowingly relying<quotes> means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient<quotes>s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it\nA patent license is <quotes>discriminatory<quotes> if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License\nYou may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all\nFor example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GPL\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software\nThis Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by <VERSION> of the GPL that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work <LICENSED> under <VERSION> of the GPL into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work\nThe terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by <VERSION> of the GPL\nRevised Versions of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the Affero GPL <quotes>or any later version<quotes> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of the Affero GPL, you can choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the Affero GPL can be used, that proxy<quotes>s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version\nDisclaimer of Warranty\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nLimitation of Liability\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\n<one line to give the program<quotes>s name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software<colon>\nyou can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the Affero GPL, either <VERSION>\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the Affero GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the Affero GPL with this program\nIf not, see <http<colon>//www.gnu.org/licenses/>\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a <quotes>copyright disclaimer<quotes> for the program, if necessary\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the AGPL, see <http<colon>//www.gnu.org/licenses/>",

keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following<colon>\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\nCopyright (C) yyyy name of author\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL;

license document, but changing it is not allowed\nThe GPL is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works\nBy contrast, the GPL is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users\nWe, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it applies also to any other work <LICENSED> this way by its authors\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nOur GPLs are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things\nTherefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it<colon>\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\nDevelopers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps<colon>\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it\nFor the developers<quotes> and authors<quotes> protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software\nFor both users<quotes> and authors<quotes> sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products\nIf such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users\nTo prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n<quotes>This License<quotes> refers to <VERSION> of the GPL\n<quotes>Copyright<quotes> also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks\n<quotes>The Program<quotes> refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nTo <quotes>modify<quotes> a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy\nTo <quotes>propagate<quotes> a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy\nTo <quotes>convey<quotes> a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies\nAn interactive user interface displays <quotes>Appropriate Legal Notices<quotes> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met\nThis License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program\nThe output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work\nThis License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright\nThose thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below\nProtecting Users<quotes> Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work<quotes>s users, your or third parties<quotes> legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures\nConveying Verbatim Copies\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy\nThis License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged\nThis License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an <quotes>aggregate<quotes> if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation<quotes>s users beyond what the individual works permit\nInclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways<colon>\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed\nAdditional Terms\n<quotes>Additional permissions<quotes> are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law\nIf additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms<colon>\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered <quotes>further restrictions<quotes> within the meaning of section 10\nIf the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term\nIf a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11)\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License\nIf your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program\nHowever, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work\nThese actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\nIf propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party<quotes>s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License\nFor example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it\nA <quotes>contributor<quotes> is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based\nThe work thus licensed is called the contributor<quotes>s <quotes>contributor version<quotes>\nA contributor<quotes>s <quotes>essential patent claims<quotes> are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version\nFor purposes of this definition, <quotes>control<quotes> includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor<quotes>s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version\nIn the following three paragraphs, a <quotes>patent license<quotes> is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement)\nTo <quotes>grant<quotes> such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients\n<quotes>Knowingly relying<quotes> means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient<quotes>s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it\nA patent license is <quotes>discriminatory<quotes> if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License\nYou may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all\nFor example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program\nUse with the Affero GPL\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work <LICENSED> under <VERSION> of the Affero GPL into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work\nThe terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the Affero GPL, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such\nRevised Versions of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GPL <quotes>or any later version<quotes> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of the GPL, you can choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GPL can be used, that proxy<quotes>s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version\nDisclaimer of Warranty\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nLimitation of Liability\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\n<one line to give the program<quotes>s name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software<colon>\nyou can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL, either <VERSION>\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

NonCommercial purposes only; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions\nThe term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a)\nThe Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so\nThe Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures\nFor purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material\nOffer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material\nEvery recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the

to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter<quotes>s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material<colon>\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis

License\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms

You can apply it to your programs, too\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nThis GPL is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software\nAlso, for each author<quotes>s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone<quotes>s free use or not licensed at all\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Affero GPL\nThe <quotes>Program<quotes>, below, refers to any such program or work, and a <quotes>work based on the Program<quotes> means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term <quotes>modification<quotes>.) Each licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License\nd) If the Program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the Program<quotes>s complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your Program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following<colon>\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nAffero Inc. can publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc\nYou can also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the Free Software Foundation<quotes>s GPL <VERSION> or higher, so long as that version of the GPL includes terms substantially equivalent to those of this license\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES",

            "goodsent": "Library GPL\nCopyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\n[This is the first <LICENSED> version of the library GPL\nIt is numbered 2 because it goes with <VERSION> of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it\nBy contrast, the GPLs are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users\nThis license, the Library GPL, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nOur GPLs are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library\nAlso, for each distributor<quotes>s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library\nWe wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone<quotes>s free use or not licensed at all\nMost software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GPL, which was designed for utility programs\nThis license, the Library GPL, applies to certain designated libraries\nThis license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don<quotes>t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it\nHowever, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary GPL treats it as such\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary GPL for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries\nWe concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better\nThis Library GPL is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary GPL rather than by this special one\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Library GPL (also called <quotes>this License<quotes>)\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nThe <quotes>Library<quotes>, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\nA <quotes>work based on the Library<quotes> means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library<quotes>s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou can opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GPL instead of this License to a given copy of the Library\nTo do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GPL, <VERSION>, instead of to this License\n(If a newer version than <VERSION> of the ordinary GPL has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GPL applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License\nHowever, linking a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quotes>work that uses the library<quotes>\nThe executable is therefore covered by this License\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\nWhen a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not\nThe threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer<quotes>s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License\nYou must supply a copy of this License\nIf the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things<colon>\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the Library GPL from time to time\nIf the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change\nYou can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary GPL)\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the Library GPL with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a <quotes>copyright disclaimer<quotes> for the library, if necessary\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library <quotes>Frob<quotes> (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker",

and that you know you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have\n(1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software\nAlso, for each author<quotes>s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\n GPL terms FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this GPL\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nYou can copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this GPL and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this GPL with the Program\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following<colon>\na) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\nb) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be <LICENSED> at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this GPL (except that you can choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users can redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this GPL\nd) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following<colon>\na) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\nb) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\nFor an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system\nYou can not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this GPL\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this GPL will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nBy copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix<colon>\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\n<one line to give the program<quotes>s name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the GPL with this program;

You can apply it to your programs, too\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nOur GPLs are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software\nAlso, for each author<quotes>s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone<quotes>s free use or not licensed at all\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this GPL\nThe <quotes>Program<quotes>, below, refers to any such program or work, and a <quotes>work based on the Program<quotes> means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term <quotes>modification<quotes>.) Each licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following<colon>\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\nCopyright (C) yyyy name of author\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the GPL with this program;

The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them\nThe <quotes>Invariant Sections<quotes> are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License\nThe <quotes>Cover Texts<quotes> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification\nThe <quotes>Title Page<quotes> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page\nThe <quotes>publisher<quotes> means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document\nThese Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties<colon>\nany other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License\nVERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License\nYou may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute\nHowever, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies\nIf you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies\nCOPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document<quotes>s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts<colon>\nBoth covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document\nMODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document<quotes>s license notice\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers\nTo do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version<quotes>s license notice\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version\nCOMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work\nCOLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document\nAGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an <quotes>aggregate<quotes> if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation<quotes>s users beyond what the individual works permit\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document<quotes>s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form\nTRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections\nYou may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers\nIn case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail\nTERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License\nFUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation can publish new, revised versions of the Free Documentation License from time to time\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License <quotes>or any later version<quotes> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy<quotes>s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document\n<quotes>CC-BY-SA<quotes> means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization\nAn MMC is <quotes>eligible for relicensing<quotes> if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008",

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library\nWe wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder\nTherefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license\nMost software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GPL\nThis license, the Lesser GPL, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary GPL\nWe use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library\nThe ordinary GPL therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom\nThe Lesser GPL permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library\nWe call this license the <quotes>Lesser<quotes> GPL because it does Less to protect the user<quotes>s freedom than the ordinary GPL\nIt also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs\nThese disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary GPL for many libraries\nHowever, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances\nIn this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser GPL\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software\nAlthough the Lesser GPL is Less protective of the users<quotes> freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Lesser GPL (also called <quotes>this License<quotes>)\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nThe <quotes>Library<quotes>, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\nA <quotes>work based on the Library<quotes> means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library<quotes>s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou can opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GPL instead of this License to a given copy of the Library\nTo do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GPL, <VERSION>, instead of to this License\n(If a newer version than <VERSION> of the ordinary GPL has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GPL applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License\nHowever, linking a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quotes>work that uses the library<quotes>\nThe executable is therefore covered by this License\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\nWhen a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not\nThe threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer<quotes>s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License\nYou must supply a copy of this License\nIf the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library\nHowever, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things<colon>\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser GPL from time to time\nIf the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change\nYou can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary GPL)\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the Lesser GPL with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a <quotes>copyright disclaimer<quotes> for the library, if necessary\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library <quotes>Frob<quotes> (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker",

license document, but changing it is not allowed\nThe GPL is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works\nBy contrast, the GPL is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users\nWe, the Free Software Foundation, use the GPL for most of our software; it applies also to any other work <LICENSED> this way by its authors\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\nOur GPLs are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things\nTherefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it<colon>\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\nDevelopers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps<colon>\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it\nFor the developers<quotes> and authors<quotes> protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software\nFor both users<quotes> and authors<quotes> sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products\nIf such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users\nTo prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\u201cThis License\u201d refers to <VERSION> of the GPL\n\u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks\n\u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License\nEach licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d\nTo \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy\nTo \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy\nTo \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies\nAn interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met\nThis License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program\nThe output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work\nThis License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright\nThose thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below\nProtecting Users<quotes> Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work<quotes>s users, your or third parties<quotes> legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures\nConveying Verbatim Copies\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program<quotes>s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy\nThis License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged\nThis License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation<quotes>s users beyond what the individual works permit\nInclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways<colon>\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed\nAdditional Terms\n\u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law\nIf additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms<colon>\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10\nIf the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term\nIf a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11)\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License\nIf your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program\nHowever, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work\nThese actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\nIf propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party<quotes>s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License\nFor example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it\nA \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based\nThe work thus licensed is called the contributor<quotes>s \u201ccontributor version\u201d\nA contributor<quotes>s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version\nFor purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor<quotes>s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement)\nTo \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients\n\u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient<quotes>s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it\nA patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License\nYou may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all\nFor example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program\nUse with the Affero GPL\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work <LICENSED> under <VERSION> of the Affero GPL into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work\nThe terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the Affero GPL, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such\nRevised Versions of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL from time to time\nIf the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GPL \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of the GPL, you can choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GPL can be used, that proxy<quotes>s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version\nDisclaimer of Warranty\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nLimitation of Liability\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\n<one line to give the program<quotes>s name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software<colon>\nyou can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL, either <VERSION>\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the GPL with this program\nIf not, see <http<colon>//www.gnu.org/licenses/>\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode<colon>\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type <quotes>show w<quotes>\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type <quotes>show c<quotes> for details\nThe hypothetical commands <quotes>show w<quotes> and <quotes>show c<quotes> should show the appropriate parts of the GPL\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GPL, see <http<colon>//www.gnu.org/licenses/>\nThe GPL does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs\nIf this is what you want to do, use the Lesser GPL instead of this License\nBut first, please read <http<colon>//www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>",

The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them\nThe <quotes>Invariant Sections<quotes> are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License\nThe <quotes>Cover Texts<quotes> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification\nThe <quotes>Title Page<quotes> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License\nYou may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute\nHowever, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies\nIf you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies\nIf you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document<quotes>s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts<colon>\nBoth covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it\nD.

and that you know you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library\nAlso, for each distributor<quotes>s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library\nWe wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone<quotes>s free use or not licensed at all\nMost software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GPL, which was designed for utility programs\nThis license, the Library GPL, applies to certain designated libraries\nThis license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don<quotes>t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it\nHowever, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary GPL treats it as such\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary GPL for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries\nWe concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better\nThis Library GPL is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary GPL rather than by this special one\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Library GPL (also called <quotes>this License<quotes>)\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nThe <quotes>Library<quotes>, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\nA <quotes>work based on the Library<quotes> means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library<quotes>s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou can opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GPL instead of this License to a given copy of the Library\nTo do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GPL, <VERSION>, instead of to this License\n(If a newer version than <VERSION> of the ordinary GPL has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GPL applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License\nHowever, linking a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quotes>work that uses the library<quotes>\nThe executable is therefore covered by this License\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\nWhen a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not\nThe threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer<quotes>s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License\nYou must supply a copy of this License\nIf the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library\nHowever, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things<colon>\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the Library GPL from time to time\nIf the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change\nYou can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary GPL)\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\nCopyright (C) year name of author\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the Library GPL with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a <quotes>copyright disclaimer<quotes> for the library, if necessary\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library <quotes>Frob<quotes> (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker",

reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter<quotes>s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material<colon>\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include

avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable\nIf the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights\n(1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library\nWe wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder\nTherefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license\nMost software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GPL\nThis license, the Lesser GPL, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary GPL\nWe use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library\nThe ordinary GPL therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom\nThe Lesser GPL permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library\nWe call this license the <quotes>Lesser<quotes> GPL because it does Less to protect the user<quotes>s freedom than the ordinary GPL\nIt also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs\nThese disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary GPL for many libraries\nHowever, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances\nIn this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser GPL\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software\nAlthough the Lesser GPL is Less protective of the users<quotes> freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\n Lesser GPL terms FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nThis License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it can be distributed under the terms of this Lesser GPL (also called <quotes>this License<quotes>)\nEach licensee is addressed as <quotes>you<quotes>\nThe <quotes>Library<quotes>, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\nA <quotes>work based on the Library<quotes> means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law<colon>\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library<quotes>s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions<colon>\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License\nIf identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\nBut when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License\nYou can opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GPL instead of this License to a given copy of the Library\nTo do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GPL, <VERSION>, instead of to this License\n(If a newer version than <VERSION> of the ordinary GPL has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices\n Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GPL applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\nYou may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>\nSuch a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License\nHowever, linking a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quotes>work that uses the library<quotes>\nThe executable is therefore covered by this License\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\nWhen a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not\nThe threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6\nAs an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes> with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer<quotes>s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License\nYou must supply a copy of this License\nIf the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable <quotes>work that uses the Library<quotes>, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library\nHowever, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\nSuch a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things<colon>\nThis must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License\nAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works\nThese actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License\nTherefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it\nEach time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients<quotes> exercise of the rights granted herein\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License\nIf you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License\nThe Free Software Foundation can publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser GPL from time to time\nIf the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and <quotes>any later version<quotes>, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\nNO WARRANTY\nBECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY <quotes>AS IS<quotes> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change\nYou can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary GPL)\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the <quotes>copyright<quotes> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found\n<one line to give the library<quotes>s name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL; either <VERSION>\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nSee the GPL for more details\nYou should have received a copy of the Lesser GPL with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a <quotes>copyright disclaimer<quotes> for the library, if necessary\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library <quotes>Frob<quotes> (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker",
